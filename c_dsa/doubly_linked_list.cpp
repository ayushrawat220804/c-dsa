doubly linked list is a collection of nodes linked together in a sequentila way.
dll note 


strct node {
int data;
struct node * prev;
struct node * next;
}

advantages:
as tike singly linked list it is the easiest data structure to implement





disadvantages:
1: it uses extra memory when compared to array and singly linked list
2: direct access is not allowed


applications of doubly linked list  in real life;

used to do undo redo
it also used to represent various states of games

basic opeatrations 
creation of list 
travesal of list in forwards and backword
insertion of node at the end of list
at any position in list, at any ebginning of the list
deletoin of last node from list
deletion of node from middle of the list 
deletion of entire list

coutning total numbers of nodes
searching an item in list
reversing the list
