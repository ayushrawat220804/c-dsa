graph data structure 
is a collection of nodes connected by edges, its used to represent relationships between different entities. graph algorithms are methods used to
manipulate and analyze graphs,
directed and undirected graph

graph terminology
adjacency :
graphcs are mainly represented in two ways:
1. adjaceny matrix
~ an adjacency matrix is a 2d array of V x V Vertices. each row and column represent a vertex.
~ if the value of any element a [i][j] is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.

2. adjacency list
~ an adjacency list represents a graph as an array.
~ 

graph operations
the most common graph openrations are:
~	check if the elements is present in the graph 
~	graph traversal 
~	add elements(vertex, edges)to graph
~	finding the path from one vertex to another
