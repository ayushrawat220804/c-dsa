## a linked list
is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays. Instead, each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists are used to overcome the limitations of arrays, especially in operations such as insertion, deletion, and dynamic memory allocation.

## Here are the key points about linked lists in C:


### 1. Node Structure
At the heart of a linked list lies the concept of a node. Each node contains two essential components:

Data: This is where the actual value or payload resides. It could be an integer, a character, a pointer, or any other data type.
Next Pointer: The next pointer (often named next) points to the next node in the list. Itâ€™s like a bridge connecting one node to the next.
