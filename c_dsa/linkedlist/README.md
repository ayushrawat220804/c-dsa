## In C,
#### a linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays. Instead, each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists are used to overcome the limitations of arrays, especially in operations such as insertion, deletion, and dynamic memory allocation.

## Here are the key points about linked lists in C:

# Node Structure:
A linked list consists of nodes. Each node contains two components:
Data: The actual value or information stored in the node.
Next Pointer: A pointer to the next node in the list.
