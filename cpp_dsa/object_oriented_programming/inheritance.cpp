inheritance 
the mechanism of deriving a new class from an old one is called inheritance or derivation

the old class is referered as base class and the new one is called the derived class
base class - super class, or parent class
derived class - sub class, extended class, or child class

for example 
let assume base class as father and derived class as son
now father have a home , money , business 
so son can access his home , money , bmw car , job 

thsi is a simple example of inheritance
